Hey there! 👋


Welcome to my Student Management System project.
I know it's a simple project, but I'm excited to share it with you! I've just finished a basic Python course, and I created this because I'm really curious about programming. It's my way of putting what I've learned into practice.

This Python-based Student Management System provides a simple yet effective way to manage student information and grades. It's designed for use by school administrators and teachers to keep track of student data and academic performance.


Features:

1.Add new students with unique IDs

2.Record and update student grades for various subjects

3.Calculate average grades for individual students

4.Retrieve information for specific students

5.List all student IDs in the system

6.Get a complete overview of all students and their information


How to Use:

Create an instance of the StudentManagementSystem class
Use the following methods to manage student data:

-add_student(id, name, age): Add a new student to the system

-add_grade(id, subject, mark): Record a grade for a specific student and subject

-average_grade(id): Calculate the average grade for a student

-get_info(id): Retrieve information for a specific student

-get_all_id(): Get a list of all student IDs in the system

-get_all_info(): Get complete information for all students
